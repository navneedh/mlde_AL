    Function called when performing MLDE from the command line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    training_data: pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe containing the columns 'AACombo' and 'Fitness'. The combo given
        by 'AACombo' will be embedded using the space given by normalized_design_space.
        This embedding will be the features used for MLDE, while the associated
        fitness will be the labels.

        should be flattened before training an sklearn model.
